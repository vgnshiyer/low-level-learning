# low-level-learning
Trying to uncover the secrets that are hidden beneath all the readymade libraries and frameworks.

# Ideas:

1. implement database indexing with B-trees
2. implement consistent hashing for distributed databases (partition routing)
3. implement distributed caching
4. implement custom error correction logic with udp
5. implement synchronization mechanisms (locks, semaphores, atomic operations) for thread safety.
